# PinooBit Code Blocks

We developed this repo to use Microbit more easily.

We are about to develop a new card called PinooBit in order to use each of the GPIO pins available on Microbit actively and easily.
When users add this extension, a scheme called PinooBit will automatically open between the block tabs.
With this estension, you will be able to easily code and use sensors compatible with PinooBit.
It's much easier for kids to learn to code with PinooBit and this extension.

You can purchase PinooBit at this link https://www.pinoo.io/

With this code blocks, our leds looks like blinking. First code is; pick your LED's connecting DigitalPin number and set value 1 or 0. If you pick 1 LED is lights up or pick 0 LED is off.
After first code add some delay with pause code block. And again pick LED set code. If first code is 0, you set this second LED code for 1. After that add delay. With this codes, our leds blinking.

This code just one example.
