# PinooBit Code Blocks

We developed this repo to use Microbit more easily.

We are about to develop a new card called PinooBit in order to use each of the GPIO pins available on Microbit actively and easily.
When users add this extension, a scheme called PinooBit will automatically open between the block tabs.
With this estension, you will be able to easily code and use sensors compatible with PinooBit.
